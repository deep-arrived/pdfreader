The malware is written in .NET programming language and spreads as a worm by copying itself under the file name in Russian to all removable disks and mapped network shares.

If the assigned disk letter is “C:\\,” for example, the files in the folder “C:\\\\Users\\\\<UserName>” are encrypted. For other removable and mapped network drives, all files that recursively branch from the root directory are encrypted. Encryption is applied to all file extensions except for “.bak” files, which are deleted.

It shares some similarities with the LockBit ransomware (registry values, ransom note filename), but it doesn’t seem to be its direct descendant. LokiLocker encrypts victim’s files on local drives and network shares with a standard combination of AES for file encryption and RSA for key protection. It then asks the victim to email the attackers to obtain instructions on how to pay the ransom. LokiLocker also boasts an optional wiper functionality - if the victim doesn’t pay up in the timeframe specified by the attacker, all non-system files will be deleted and the MBR overwritten, wiping all the victim’s files and rendering the system unusable. With a single stroke, everyone loses. LokiLocker works as a limited- access Ransomware-as-a-Service scheme that appears to be sold to a relatively small number of carefully vetted affiliates behind closed doors.
