It appends the affected files with the .locked extension. If a file was previously named picture.jpg, after encryption, it would look like this - picture.jpg.locked. The icons are also changed to white pages so thumbnails become unavailable. In the note, victims are informed that their files have been encrypted using military grade AES-256 bit encryption algorithm. Cybercriminals demand 0.25 Bitcoin if users want to recover their files.

RansomExx is operated by the DefrayX threat actor group (Hive0091), which is also known for the PyXie malware, Vatet loader, and Defray ransomware strains. The newly discovered ransomware version is named RansomExx2 according to strings found within the ransomware and is designed to run on the Linux operating system. The group has historically released both Linux and Windows versions of their ransomware, so it is likely that a Windows version is also in the works. RansomExx2 has been completely rewritten using Rust, but otherwise, its functionality is similar to its C++ predecessor. It requires a list of target directories to encrypt to be passed as command line parameters and then encrypts files using AES-256, with RSA used to protect the encryption keys. Each encrypted file is given a new file extension. It is common for RansomExx ransomware file extensions to be based on a variation of the target company name, sometimes followed by the numbers such as ‘911’ or random characters.  | Ransomware RansomExx2 RansomExx Upgrades to Rust. https://securityintelligence.com/posts/ransomexx-upgrades-rust/",

It claims the victim’s files were encrypted using “unknown algorithms.” However, analysis determined that the ransomware uses the Windows certutil -encode command to encode files. This means that these “unknown algorithms” are base64. The ransom fee is set at $150, which is considered low.

BlueSky ransomware predominantly targets Windows hosts and utilizes multithreading to encrypt files on the host for faster encryption. BlueSky implements multiple anti-analysis techniques, including string encryption, API obfuscation, and anti-debugging mechanisms, allowing it to obfuscate Windows API function names and use indirect calls for resolving APIs.

Once the ransomware runs, it deletes all files in the following special folders: MyPictures, Desktop, MyMusic, Personal (this is the same as MyDocuments), StartMenu, Favorites, Cookies, and ApplicationData. It then tries to delete those folders as well. The destructive behavior does not end there, as it also erases shadow copies. Although the victim has no way to recover the deleted files, the ransomware drops a few ransom notes named readme.txt, readme.html, and readme.hta. These ransom notes claim that files on the victim’s machine are encrypted, and the only way to get the affected files back is to pay $500 worth of Ethereum for a decryption key. This is obviously a scam to get victims to, unfortunately, pay for unrecoverable files.

The threat actors behind Octocrypt operate under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model and surfaced on cybercrime forums around October 2022 for USD400. Based on static analysis, the ransomware is a console-based 64-bit GoLang binary executable. Upon execution, the ransomware initially ensures the system’s internet connection and then checks the TCP connection to access the API URL.

Encrypted files have their extensions changed to “cryptn8” by default. However, this could be configured to anything should the attacker choose to change it. Once all files have been encrypted, Cryptonite tries to identify where the victim is in the world from their IP address using “ipinfo.io” and attempts to phone home.
