        "Kelihos Backdoor": "The Kelihos backdoor is able to rope the affected system into the Kelihos botnet, which is typically used to send out spam email messages. Kelihos malware is often dropped and installed as the payload of other malware, such as trojan- downloaders. Some variants are also distributed via links to malicious websites that are circulated through the Facebook social network. Once the malware has been installed on a system, it typically tries to contact a remote server and download its other components, including a backdoor that gives remote attackers further control over the affected system. The backdoor also connects the system to a botnet under the attacker’s control. Once included in the botnet, the affected system may be instructed to download other malware, or be used to send spam email messages to other victims. It may also be directed to perform other malicious actions, such as stealing Bitcoins.  Active threat, added in KB https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/backdoor_w32_kelihos.shtml",

Researchers have identified a likely persona on carding forums associated with this activity, which suggests the attacker monetizes stolen credit card data through sales rather than direct use of stolen cards themselves. The persona used for the GitHub and carding account, and several of the domains, have a history going back to 2013, which suggests the attacker may have been attempting similar attacks for up to eight years, with only one significant public mention of their activity.
