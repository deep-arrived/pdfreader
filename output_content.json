        "Macaw": "Evil Corp launched a ransomware called Macaw Locker to evade US sanctions that prevent victims from making ransom payments. The Macaw Locker ransomware encrypts victims’ files and appends the .macaw extension to the file name when conducting attacks. While encrypting files, the ransomware also creates ransom notes in each folder named macaw_recover.txt. For each attack, the ransom note contains a unique victim negotiation page on the Macaw Locker’s Tor site and an associated decryption ID, or campaign ID. The gang’s dark web negotiation site contains a brief introduction to what happened to the victim, a tool to decrypt three files for free, and a chatbox to negotiate with the attackers.",

In other words, victims are unable to use their devices until they pay the ransom. However, at the time of research, the ZLO screenlocker’s message could be removed by rebooting/restarting the infected system. The text presented in the ransom note with which ZLO locks the screen - states that victims must pay 100 EUR in Bitcoin cryptocurrency to unlock their device.

Via this scheme, the ads often promotes a valuable program with appealing features and benefits to influence web users into downloading a copy. Once executed, virus drops certain executable files on system directories. It will then search the store for common files and encrypt them with a complex algorithm that according to security experts - requires a complex way of decryption.

This usually begins with a large number of machines receiving emails containing a document that users may unwittingly download. The attachment contains an Emotet Trojan malware bot that activates if the file is downloaded. The second stage of the attack sees the Emotet bot communicate with its servers to install another piece of malware known as a Trickbot.

CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that GOLD HERON is comprised of former operators from the GOLD DRAKE threat group. At the time of the split, GOLD DRAKE operated both the BitPaymer ransomware and Dridex botnet and GOLD HERON is thought to be in possession of the source code for both malware families. GOLD HERON adopted the name DoppelPaymer for their ransomware after security researchers used the moniker to refer to it publicly. Intrusions largely rely on the modified Dridex malware, colloquially referred to as Dridex 2.0, for both initial access and lateral movement. GOLD HERON uses spam emails, sometimes delivered using the Cutwail v2 botnet, to deliver Dridex onto victims’ networks. Frequently, PowerShell Empire or Cobalt Strike are deployed into the environment to augment the capabilities of Dridex."
