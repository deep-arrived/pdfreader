The “Yashma” version has just two advancements added to differentiate itself from previous iterations. It now has functionality to prevent it from running based on the victim’s location, determined via the language set on the victim device. This is a ploy often used by threat actors to avoid legal trouble in their country of origin. What makes Chaos/Yashma dangerous going forward is its flexibility and its widespread availability. As the malware is initially sold and distributed as a malware builder, any threat actor who purchases the malware can replicate the actions of the threat group behind Onyx, developing their own ransomware strains and targeting chosen victims.

These file extensions are associated with ESXi snapshots, log files, swap files, paging files, and virtual disks. Each encrypted file will have the “.Cheers” extension appended to its filename.
