        "AiDLocker": "AiDLocker Ransomware has been in development since the start of July 2022. AiDLocker Ransomware will likely post victims onto Telegram, however there is evidence they will maybe also run a leak site. AiDLocker Ransomware is likely from Russia, due to its relationship to other Russian groups.

        "SOVA v5": "SOVA is an Android Banking Trojan. SOVA v5 comes with numerous code improvements and the addition of new features such as a ransomware module. The module uses AES encryption to lock all files in infected devices and append the “.enc” extension on the renamed, encrypted files. The ransomware feature is quite interesting as it’s still not common in the Android banking trojans landscape. It strongly leverages the opportunity arisen in recent years, as mobile devices became for most people the central storage for personal and business data.  | What is SOVA? SOVA malware is back and is evolving rapidly. https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/sova-malware-is-back-and-is-evolving- rapidly",

        "SolidBit": "SolidBit ransomware is a .NET compiled binary. SolidBit variant uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption to encrypt the files in its victim’s computer. The ransomware will also terminate multiple services, delete any shadow copies and backup catalogs, and delete 42 services in the victim’s computer. It also drops a file, RESTORE-MY-FILES.txt, that contains instructions on how a victim can pay the ransom to every directory and shows a pop-up window on the victim’s machine. SolidBit has been suspected of being a LockBit ransomware copycat, as the two share similarities in their chat support sites’ formatting and the file names of their ransom note. However, SolidBit ransomware is compiled using .NET and is actually a variant of Yashma ransomware, also known as Chaos.  | Solid Bit Ransomware SolidBit Ransomware Enters the RaaS Scene and Takes Aim at Gamers and Social Media Users With New Variant. https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/h/solidbit-ransomware-enters- the-raas-scene-and-takes-aim-at-gamer.html",
        "Industrial Spy": "The Industrial Spy ransomware family is relatively basic and parts of the code appear to be in development. Industrial Spy utilizes very few obfuscation methods other than building strings on the stack at runtime. The ransomware also lacks many of the features commonly seen in modern ransomware families (such as anti-debug, anti-sandbox, etc.), although this may change in the future. Industrial Spy encrypts each file’s content with the Triple DES (3DES) algorithm. Each 3DES key and initialization vector (IV) are then encrypted with a hardcoded RSA public key. The result is appended with a footer to the encrypted file data. Industrial Spy will encrypt up to the first 100MB of data. Unlike nearly all ransomware families, Industrial Spy does not change the file extension after encryption. Therefore, the filename itself cannot be used to determine the files that have been encrypted. Instead, Industrial Spy appends a file footer that can be used to identify encrypted files using the last four bytes: 0xFEEDBEEF.

In January 2022, a new, improved version of nccTrojan was identified - 2.45, as evidenced by the path to the .pdb file and the configuration information of the malware. The installation of nccTrojan is performed by downloading files from the PortDoor CnC server. The executable file (DLL library) of nccTrojan is downloaded as a .cab archive with an arbitrary name. Like PortDoor, nccTrojan has backdoor functionality. Thus, the attackers get two channels for controlling the infected system at the same time. In addition, nccTrojan has functionality that uploads information collected by the attackers to the CnC server. Among other things, it is used to steal files containing confidential information.

        "Donut Leaks": "Donut Leaks is a data extortion group linked to cyberattacks, including those on Greek natural gas company DESFA, UK architectural firm Sheppard Robson, and multinational construction company Sando. Once the threat actors finish stealing data, they email URLs of their Tor extortion sites to the victim’s business partners and employees. These Tor sites consist of a shaming blog and a data storage site that allows visitors to browse and download all of the stolen, leaked data. The shaming blog currently contains entries for five victims, with all but one containing generic descriptions of the company and links to their stolen data. It is unknown whether the threat actors deploy ransomware when breaching networks or are simply a data extortion group.

To do this, the threat actors replace the configuration of the REvil ransomware binary with their own in an effort to repurpose the ransomware for their operations. GOLD NORTHFIELD has given this modified REvil ransomware variant the name “LV ransomware”. GOLD NORTHFIELD operates multiple Tor-based ransom payment sites and at least two different name-and-shame leak sites that are both active and follow the same format but contain mostly unique victims. GOLD NORTHFIELD typically threatens to publicly release sensitive information if victims do not initiate contact within 72 hours. The threat actors include screenshots of the victim’s sensitive files to support their claims. Variations in partner and campaign IDs across LV configurations and the practice of naming and shaming victims could indicate that GOLD NORTHFIELD may operate a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering.

In July 2020, researchers observed UNC2198 leverage network access provided by an ICEDID infection to encrypt an environment with MAZE ransomware. As the year progressed into October and November, they observed UNC2198 shift from deploying MAZE to using EGREGOR ransomware during another Incident Response engagement.  | What is UNC 2198?
