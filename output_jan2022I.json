Rook ransomware is primarily delivered via a third-party framework, for example, Cobalt Strike; however, delivery via phishing email has also been reported in the wild. The ransomware attempts to terminate any process that may interfere with encryption. As with most modern ransomware families, Rook will also attempt to delete volume shadow copies to prevent victims from restoring from backup. This is achieved via vssadmin.exe. Early variants of Rook were reported to have used a .TOWER extension. All current variants seen by researchers use the .ROOK extension.

After launch, the ransomware requests to access files on the device. After obtaining that permission, it encrypts files on external media with certain extensions. Selected files are encrypted using AES with a randomly generated 16-character key. After CryCryptor encrypts a file, three new files are created, and the original file is removed.
