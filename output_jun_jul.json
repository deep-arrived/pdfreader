        "WannaFriendMe": "WannaFriendMe impersonates the notorious Ryuk Ransomware. However, in reality, it is a variant of the Chaos Ransomware. In June 2021, a threat actor began selling a Chaos ransomware builder that allowed wannabe criminals to create their very own ransomware infection with customized ransom notes, encrypted file extensions, and other features. By default, the Chaos builder pretends to be Ryuk, using the .ryuk extension for encrypted files. Instead of demanding cryptocurrency as a ransom payment, it requires victims to purchase a decryptor from Roblox’s Game Pass store using Robux.  | Ransomware Wanna Friend Me Bizarre ransomware sells decryptor on Roblox Game Pass store. https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bizarre-ransomware-sells- decryptor-on-roblox-game-pass-store/",
        "Midas": "Midas is the rebranded version of Haron ransomware. It is designed to encrypt data (lock files) and demand ransoms for decryption. Malware of this type typically renames the encrypted files, since Midas ransomware primarily targets companies and other large entities - it appends filenames with an extension consisting of the company’s name (e.g., “1.jpg” as “1.jpg.newwave”). The ransom note states that the files have been encrypted, and sensitive data (e.g., financial and HR documents, contracts, client information, etc.) was exfiltrated. Victims are told to establish contact with cyber criminals within 72 hours, or the stolen content will be leaked online.

Once encrypted, the files receive a new extension, appended past their original one, that consists of four random alphanumeric characters. This means that if a file was called “picture.jpg” before encryption, it can turn into something like “picture.jpg.yhu8”. The ransomware drops its ransom demands inside a plain text file named “READMEEEEEE!!!!.txt” and also changes the Windows wallpaper, using either a cartoon image or repeating the ransom note.

It is common for threat actors to leverage existing code, modify it, and rebrand it. Unlike Babuk ransomware, the DarkAngels are using the malware to target specific organizations. This approach shows some TAs are specifically selecting their targets. The malware enumerates the system and excludes the folders such as AppData, Boot, Windows, Windows.old, etc., from the encryption process. The ransomware specifically excludes files such as autorun.inf, boot.ini, bootfont. bin, etc., from encryption. The ransomware also excludes file extensions such as .exe, .dll, and .babyk. The .babyk is a well-known extension for Babuk ransomware which indicates the DarkAngels is linked to Babuk ransomware. Like Babuk ransomware, the DarkAngels appends a signature “choung dong looks like hot dog” at the end of the encrypted file, indicating the ransomware is linked to Babuk. The ransomware appends a .crypt extension to encrypted files.

To achieve that, Luna Moth relies on phishing attacks. The group managed a large-scale campaign luring victims with false subscription emails for using Zoho, MasterClass, or Duolingo services. Victims would receive a message allegedly from one of the aforementioned services announcing that the subscription is about to end and that it will be automatically renewed, with 24 hours to process the payment. Luna Moth uses email addresses with names that impersonate the brands used in the phishing campaign. Looking closer, the scam is obvious since the messages come from Gmail accounts.
