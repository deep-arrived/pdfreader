        "Bisamware": "Bisamware is a Windows-focused ransomware reportedly distributed through Microsoft Word files designed to exploit CVE-2022-30190. This vulnerability is in Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) and abuses the MSDT URI scheme to download and run a malicious payload. Once executed, Bisamware ransomware will encrypt files on a compromised machine and add a “.BISAMWARE” ransomware extension to affected files. It leaves a ransom note named “SYSTEM=RANSOMWARE=INFECTED. txt” that directs victims to contact the attacker through a chat room on TOR and purchase a decryption key.

        "Azov": "Azov Ransomware is a data wiper that is heavily distributed through pirated software, key generators, and adware bundles, trying to frame well-known security researchers by claiming they are behind the attack. The Azov Ransomware falsely claims to have been created by a well-known security researcher named Hasherazade and lists other researchers and BleepingComputer, as involved in the operation. The ransom note, named RESTORE_FILES.txt, says that devices are encrypted in protest of the seizure of Crimea and because Western countries are not doing enough to help Ukraine in their war against Russia. In a campaign, a threat actor appears to have purchased ‘installs’ through the SmokeLoader malware botnet to deliver the new destructive Azov wiper. When encrypting files, it appends the .azov file extension to the names of encrypted files. For example, 1.doc is encrypted and renamed to 1.doc.azov.

        "Chile Locker": "Chile Locker is a ransomware. Chile’s CSIRT team issued an alert about this variant at the end of August 2022, stating it had affected a government service in Chile on August 25th. Despite the warning, Chile Locker variants were subsequently submitted to VirusTotal from Canada, Mexico, Romania, China, the UK, Spain, Uruguay, Netherlands, Russia, Poland, Malaysia, and the U.S., which indicates that the ransomware attacker did not specifically target Chile. Chile Locker encrypts files on a compromised machine and adds a “.crypt” extension to the affected files. It also drops a ransom note in “readme_for_unlock.txt”. While researchers have been unable to get the ransomware to generate a ransom note, it reportedly demands the victim either contact or reaches a deal with the attacker within three days through a Tor site operated by the attacker.

        "Prestige": "Prestige ransomware was used to target transportation and logistics organizations in Ukraine and Poland in attacks. This ransomware was first used in the wild on October 11, 2022 in attacks detected within an hour of each other. Attackers were seen deploying the ransomware payloads across their victims’ enterprise networks, a tactic very rarely seen in attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations. Once deployed, Prestige ransomware payloads will drop ransom notes named “README.txt” in the root directory of each drive it encrypts. It encrypts files based on extensions matching a predefined list and adds the .enc extension at the end of the files’ names after encryption. It uses the CryptoPP C++ library to AES-encrypt each matching file on compromised systems, and it will delete the backup catalog and all volume shadow copies to hinder recovery efforts.

However, there was another ransomware using the same encrypted file extension since 2021, but it is unclear if they are related.

When Ransom Cartel first appeared, it was unclear whether it was a rebrand of REvil or an unrelated threat actor who reused or mimicked REvil ransomware code. During encryption, Ransom Cartel specifically seeks out files with the following file extensions: .log, .vmdk, .vmem, .vswp and .vmsn.
